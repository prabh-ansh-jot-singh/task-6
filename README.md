# Task 6: Strong Password Creation and Evaluation

## Objective
Understand what makes a password strong, evaluate different passwords using online tools, and summarize best practices.

## Steps Taken
1. Created 4 passwords with different levels of complexity.
2. Tested them on [passwordmeter.com](https://www.passwordmeter.com/) and [security.org password checker](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/).
3. Collected results, analyzed feedback, and identified best practices.

## Results
| Password                  | Score (%) | Time to Crack             | Feedback                        |
|---------------------------|-----------|---------------------------|---------------------------------|
| apple123                  | 20%       | < 1 second                | Too short, predictable          |
| Apple2025!                | 55%       | Few hours                 | Better, but still guessable     |
| Tr!ckyPassw0rd@2025       | 85%       | Hundreds of years         | Strong password                 |
| M0re$ecure&Unique!987654  | 100%      | Billions of years         | Excellent complexity + length   |

## Best Practices Learned
- Use at least 12–16 characters.
- Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols.
- Avoid dictionary words and personal info.
- Use unique passwords for each account.
- Passphrases (e.g., `Blue!Sky^Ocean2025`) are easier to remember but still strong.
- Always enable multi-factor authentication (MFA).

## Research
- **Brute Force Attack**: Automated guessing of all possible combinations.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Using a list of common passwords or words to guess.
- **Password Managers**: Help generate, store, and autofill strong unique passwords.
